# Creating RPM packages for Nodejs modules

Picking up where https://github.com/lkundrak/npm2rpm left off, this
Rubygem creates RPM packages from Nodejs modules.

It differs from the original implementation as follows
* Uses Ruby
* Much more robust
* Ability to package multiple versions of the same module
* Spec generated from template
* Support for multiple Linux distributions possible
